This web-page was created in order to showcase the projects I have done as a student of Moringa School, in the Prep Program. It also gives a detailed description of my bio, from my family life , my hobbies, my educational background and professional background. The web-page is a culmination of all the lessons learned during week 1 including the use of tools like git, github and atom, as well as the use of HTML, CSS and MD programming languages.
