    <h3>ME, MYSELF & I</h3>
      <p>My name is Faith Wanjeri but I’m also known as simply, Fawa. I am a blessed wife and a proud mum
        of two little ones. I have a background in Law and International Relations. I have garnered 10 years’ experience in
        project management, event management, and digital communications.</p>
      <p>I am a co-founder of AfriVA, a women-led organization that has organized high-level events for youth and women.
        I have previously worked for Infonet Africa, Timeless Women of Wonder Foundation, USIU- Africa and Nokia East Africa.
        In my various capacities in the aforementioned organizations, I have successfully led projects in the Office of the
        Deputy President, Zambia Government, Kwale and Tharaka County Governments, African Union Commission, East African
        Commission, National Youth Council-Kenya, East African Community, UN Women, UN-Habitat and World Youth Parliament.</p>
      <p>The last organization I worked for piqued my interest in the IT world. I came on board to simply manage the developers,
        and present progress reports to our clients. Seeing websites and apps come to life was honestly magical for me. I was
        intrigued and I desired to do more than supervise. I wanted to create. When I left, I started working on a few websites
        on my own, borrowing lessons from YouTube and blogs. They can however only take you so far. So I started looking for a
        software development course from a recognized institution and I stumbled upon Moringa. I am a firm believer in self-paced
        learning, but there is merit to peer learning and team-work and that is what Moringa will facilitate.</p>
      <p>So why formally learn programming, one may ask. The analogy I would use is that I have a swiss army knife and the only
        tool I have used so far is the screw-driver, because that’s the only one I know how to use. I can’t wait to learn how to
        code in different languages and the fullest capability of each.</p>
